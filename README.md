# Machine Learning Assisted Causal Inference for Small Datasets

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper titled "Machine Learning Assisted Causal Inference for Small Datasets," submitted as part of the "Group Project Unit" (code: MATH30009) at the University of Bristol.

## Files
1. `causal_inference.r`
   Contains code for estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE) using Doubly Robust and Modified AIPW estimators with both logistic regression and random forest-based methods employed for nuisance parameter estimation in each case.
2. `plotting.r`
   Code to generate and save plots showing the Mean and Median MSE of district level ATE estimates across different numbers of simulation runs for the true ATE.
